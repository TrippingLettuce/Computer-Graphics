# Project 1: Sierpinski Gasket

  This project aims to visualize mathematical gaskets using OpenGL. <br> A gasket is a fractal, a complex structure built from the repetition of simple patterns at every scale. <br> In this project, we focus on two types of gaskets: the 2D Sierpinski Triangle and the 3D Sierpinski Tetrahedron. <br> The purpose of the project is to understand the functionality of the code and scrutinizing the OpenGL libraries.

Ensure you have g++ installed. You can check this by running:
```
g++ --version
```
Ensure you have the required libraries (GLUT, GLU, and GL) installed. On many Linux distributions, you can install them using the package manager. <br>
For example, on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
```
Navigate to the directory containing your source code :
```
cd home/path
```
Compile the source code using the provided command:
```
g++ [name.cpp] -o [newName] -lglut -lGLU -lGL
```
After successful compilation, you can run the program with:
```
./[newName]
```
